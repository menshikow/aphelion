> The project is a **real-time N-body physics simulation engine** developed in **C++** and **OpenGL**, utilizing **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation** to model the non-linear interactions of celestial bodies in 3D space. The system employs **numerical integration** (specifically Semi-Implicit Euler or Velocity Verlet) to iteratively resolve kinetic states and implements a **programmable rendering pipeline** to visualize trajectories relative to a spatial reference grid, managed via **Model-View-Projection (MVP)** matrix transformations.
